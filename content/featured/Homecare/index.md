Homecare.dkonsul.com is a platform that enables people to access home health services customized to their needs, at affordable prices, and directly managed by professionals. I designed the Homecare app and CMS, which launched in 2024, achieving 15,000 user visits and generating a GMV of over 500 million IDR. A usability score (SUS) rated "good," and a satisfaction score (CSAT) as "highly satisfactory."
